    <p><center>I am Angelo, 22 years old living in the beautiful and small town of Sampaloc, Quezon. 
    <p><center>A student of Pambayang Kolehiyo ng Mauban. A young man who have a dream to finish my study and help my family,
    <p><center> A man whose responsible and full of joy while experiencing difficulty. I have two sister who's older than me, one brother and one youngest
    <p><center> sister. My mother is a house wife but she's still doing her best to provide us, she's my strength, my inspiration, and my hope. Yes I'am  
    <p><center> a Mama's boy. While my father is a OFW in Saudi I am very proud to him despite of all those thing that he done to us, i have no rights to judge
    <p><center> him, yes we have a misunderstanding in the past years i hate my father because he left us when we need him, especially those time that we need a guide 
    <p><center> of a father, we need his presence but he's not here but now he's back and he want to take back those time.
    <p><center> Way back when I'm still in high school i'm very active when it comes in extracurricular activity i joined differents competitions like dancing, poem,theater,
    <p><center> quizbee and etc and thank god i'm always got a medal. After i graduated in Senior High School at Manuel S. Enverga Academy Foundation Inc
    <p><center> with honors and leadership award i pursue my college and take an entrance exam in Southern Luzon University but i failed, I'm confident that
    <p><center> i can pass the entrance examination that time but i did'nt pass after that a problem came up which is about my father then i realized this is not
    <p><center> the right time, then i decided to work in Lucena City as a cashier and cook because i want to help my mom and i don't want to become a burden to her  
    <p><center> i want to live in my own while supporting them, i want to become an independant man, but again a problem came up, there's a boy who caught my attention 
    <p><center> it's very knew to me those feeling that i felt towards to him. No one's there for me because i'm living with different people our land lord and my dorm mate.   
    <p><center> i struggle a lot during that time every morning and even evening i can't stop crying then i give up i resign because i can't focus to my work and i miss my mom
    <p><center> then I go back to Sampaloc. After that i applied again a work here in Sampaloc as a cashier in a milktea shop, they have a good services also good salary.
    <p><center> I'm always remember a quote that i saw in my favorite wattpad stories 'there's always a rainbow after the rain' a good opportunity came up my father message me 
    <p><center> that i can continue my college. i take an entrance examination in Pambayang Kolehiyo ng Mauban and thank god i passed that time i'm in the middle of my duty 
    <p><center> my co-workers surprise because i shout because i'm very happy that's why i'm very thankful for the opportunity of Pambayang Kolehiyo ng Mauban give to us especially
    <p><center> to those people who have a financial problem like me. I will never waste this opportunity! and i will ensure you i will graduate and become a Teacher.
